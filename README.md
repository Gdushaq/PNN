# PNN – Photonic Neural Network Framework

This repository contains a hardware-aware photonic neural network (PNN) framework integrating experimentally measured nonlinear 2D material responses for weight update and activation modeling.

## Objectives

- Integrate experimentally extracted phase–voltage characteristics of 2D materials
- Model hardware non-idealities in photonic neural networks
- Enable co-design between photonic devices and AI training
- Develop next-generation energy-efficient photonic AI systems

## Structure

- `device_models/` – Nonlinear 2D material models (CIPS, α-In₂Se₃, etc.)
- `training/` – ONN training pipelines
- `notebooks/` – Experimental notebooks and simulations
- `experiments/` – Reproducible experiments

## Status

Early-stage development – actively evolving.
